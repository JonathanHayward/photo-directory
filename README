application, see one or more of:

If you would like to play around with it instead of deploying it immediately,
edit the settings.py file so that line 8 says:

    DEBUG = True

Then run:

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver

And point your browser to:

    http://localhost:8000/
